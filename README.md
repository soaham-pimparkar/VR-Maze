# VR-Maze

To get a better understanding of virtual reality through project-based learning, I have built this first-person VR-based maze solving game using Unity 3D Game Engine 

Resources and Softwares used:
Unity 3D engine
Google GVR sdk
Dev assets (https://lnkd.in/dv2KTMqH)

The player is spawned at the start point from where he needs to navigate through the maze by tilting the device (headset) in the desired direction to move or look at the floor to stop moving and reach the end-line to win the game.
